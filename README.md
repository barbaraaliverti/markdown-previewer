# Markdown Previewer

This is a solution to the [Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) challenge. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a open source platform to to help people learn to code for free.

## Overview

### The challenge

Build a markdown previewer using any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery (I chose React and Bootstrap).

- User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

- User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

- User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

- User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

- User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

**Optional Bonus**: My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- React
- react-markdown library

### How to run this project locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### What I learned

This was my first ever React project, initialy built on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/baloobali/pen/rNebvEM), so I used class components because it was what I learned first.
I learned some React basics such as how to work with props, and how to build components. I didn't want to spend too much time on styling so I chose Bootstrap to help me with this.

### Continued development and improvements

This is quite a simple app so I don't intend to make any improvements to it, but If I were to develop it again, I would use function components and hooks instead of class components. I would also use Styled Components or MaterialUI for the styling instead of a single stylesheet.
